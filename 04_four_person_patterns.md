# 4-Person Patterns

## Boxes

The box is a classic passing pattern with dozens of variations, many of which
have been around for a long time. It's a great foundation for innovating new
patterns.

### Basic 4-Count Box

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     |       |
| **B**       | A     |       |
| **C**       |       | D     |
| **D**       |       | C     |

> * Right hand counting

### 2-Count Box

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     |       | B     |       |
| **B**       | A     |       | A     |       |
| **C**       |       | D     |       | D     |
| **D**       |       | C     |       | C     |

> * Both hands counting
> * A, B start with right
> * C, D start with left

### 1-Count Asynchronous Box

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | B     |
| **B**       | A     | A     |
| **C**       | D     | D     |
| **D**       | C     | C     |

> * Both hands counting

This is a good exercise to practice timing. All jugglers throw at exactly the
same time. Wide throws make it a little easier. You can do the same pattern with
synchronous ultimates, but that's pretty hard.

Almost any staggered passing pattern will work with a box, and many that are
synchronous. A moving variation in 4 count is for C and D to swap places when A
and B pass and vice versa. Other variations are Pistons and the Minuet.

### Extra Club Boxes

* **13 Club Box** – Throw a double right pass to the juggler on your left in
    4-count. Each passer passes on their own beat.
* **14 Club Box** – This can be done with pairs of jugglers synchronized in a 7
    club 2-count, but it is easiest if each juggler is ½ beat after each other.
* **14 Club 4-Count Box** – This is a box where each pair of juggler does 7
    club 4-count with triples. The two pairs are 1 beat away from each other (A
    and B's rights are synchronized with C and D's lefts).
* **16 Club Box** – There are several nice 16 club box variations. To reduce
    collisions, have A and C throw triples while B and D throw singles (½ beat
    after each other). The overall timing is about the same as 8 doubles (or 7
    singles). This is a pretty pattern. You can also do a 16 club box pattern
    with all the jugglers synchronized in 8 club 2-count singles, doubles or
    triples. Nice! Pass either straight across, or to the juggler on the left.
* **18 Club Box** – With 9 club triples 2 count and each juggler offset ½ beat.
  However, if you are doing this pattern, you probably don't need our
  suggestions on club passing in a box... Very cool, but tricky!

### 14-Club Ultimate Box

 If the timing is perfect, it is possible to do a 14 club box in 1-count, with
right hand doubles across the box and left hand singles along the edges of the
box.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | D-B   | C     |
| **B**       | D     | D-A   |
| **C**       | D-D   | B     |
| **D**       | A     | D-C   |

> * Both hands counting
> * A and C start with 4 clubs and right hands
> * B and D start with 3 clubs and left hands

Throw a little wide on the double passes and make sure that everyone has
metronome perfect timing and it actually works!

### Extra Club Rotating Feed (for 4 jugglers)

This is a box pattern with a rotating feed for 4 jugglers and one extra club; both directions work.

|             |        |        |       |        |        |       |        |        |       |        |        |        |

> * Both hands counting, all right hand throws are either double passes or double selves
> * A starts with 4 clubs
> * A and B start with right hand
> * C and D start with left hand

The steady state right hand sequence is pass across, pass left, self, pass
across, self.

### Gustav

This is a double 3-count extra club pattern for four jugglers in a box pattern.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |

> * Both hands counting
> * A starts with 4 clubs
> * A throws triple crosses, B throws triple straights
> * C and D start slightly after A and B – timing is a bit wonky

Pattern by Luke Emery, 2008 and named after the hurricane.

## Switch Sides Feed

The standard Switch Sides Feed is an easy introduction to moving while passing.
The extra club version is a fun and spectacular pattern.  The basic idea is that a feeder feeds three feedees, but the feedees on the end
move straight across after every pass so that the middle feedee becomes the new
feeder after each sweep.

### Windshield Wiper Switch Sides Feed

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | C     | D     | C     |       | C     |       | C     |
| **B**       | A     |       |       |       | C     |       |       |       |
| **C**       |       | A     |       | A     | B     | A     | D     | A     |
| **D**       |       |       | A     |       |       |       | C     |       |

> * Right hands counting
> * Start with right hand

In this version, movers go back and forth, passing 8-count.

### Typewriter Switch Sides Feed

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | C     | D     |       | C     |       |
| **B**       | A     |       |       | C     |       |       |
| **C**       |       | A     |       | B     | A     | D     |
| **D**       |       |       | A     |       |       | C     |

> * Right hands counting
> * Start with right hand

### Extra Club Switch Sides Feed

In this version, weavers move back and forth in an 6-count. This is a fun one.

|             |        |       |       |        |       |       |       |        |       |        |        |        |        |        |

## Weaves

### Standard Weave

Here's where the fun really begins! This is a great pattern to master because it
leads to many other exciting patterns. 


|      |         |
|------|--------|
| ![](./media/image4.jpeg){width=40%}   | ![](./media/weaveTable.png){width=37%} |
|             | Right-hand counting |
The feeder, A, throws to the end, middle, end, middle and then repeats, passing in 2-count. 
 That's called a wind-shield wiper feed (as opposed to a typewriter feed that only goes in one direction).  Each weaver, (B,C,D), passes in their current position and then moves to the next
position. For the standard weave, the three movers pass in a 6-count, moving back on the ends and forward in the middle in a figure eight pattern.  Beginners have a tendency to move well side-to-side but not so
well backwards and forwards;  think of the pattern more like a bowtie than a figure 8 if that's a problem. Notice
also that it's a 12-beat cycle for everyone to get back to the same positions, 
but the passing cycle takes on 3 beats, as the table above shows. 

![](./media/image5.png){width=60%} 

Note on starting: The middle weaver moves towards the end that passes to the feeder first.

Here's another look at the details of the standard weave; the feeder exchanges with jugglers in positions 1, 4, 7,
and 10 (which is 4, going the other way).  Weavers move regularly through the 12 positions. This detail is
helpful when we start thinking about Fois-Graham and other complicated double weaves.

![](./media/weavedetail.png){width=40%} 

**Variations:**

Oh, there are so many variations of the weave! The mind boggles. To start, try
with left handed throws in 2-count feeding. Try moving forward on the ends and
back in the middle (an inverted weave). Now try with chocolate bar (feeder
throws ultimates, Right, and then Left to each feeder.)

You can do this pattern with an extra club, all passes as doubles, or all throws
as singles, or feeder throwing singles and weavers throwing triples, or feeder
throwing all triples and weavers throwing singles.

Do this pattern with 2 extra clubs and all the passes are triples.

Slow it down and pass twice in a row from the feeder to each weaver.

In general, the weavers can move in many different counts, and the feeder can
choose a pattern that makes the weave work as long as two weavers aren't passing
at the same time. You can slow the weave down if you want, or speed it up. Here
are some examples (all of these in both hands counting):

### 5-Count Weave: Feeder PSPSP=5/3-Count, Feedees 5-Count

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   | **9**   | **10**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| **A**       | B       |         | C       |         | D       | B       |         | C       |         | D        |
| **B**       | A       |         |         |         |         | A       |         |         |         |          |
| **C**       |         |         | A       |         |         |         |         | A       |         |          |
| **D**       |         |         |         |         | A       |         |         |         |         | A        |

There are other variations that also work out as a 5-count Weave (like the
feeder throwing PPPSS instead of PSPSP).

### Double 3-Count Weave:  Feeder 3/2-Count, Feedees 4-then-5-Count

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   | **9**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | B       |         | C       | D       |         | B       | C       |         | D       |
| **B**       | A       |         |         |         |         | A       |         |         |         |
| **C**       |         |         | A       |         |         |         | A       |         |         |
| **D**       |         |         |         | A       |         |         |         |         | A       |

In this variation, the weavers move in a 5 count to the middle and a 4 count to
the outsides. We also call this the 4-count-5-count weave. Notice the 3/2 feeder starts pass-self-pass-pass.    The inverse works too, but is a bit harder.

The variations with a 4-count or 3 of 4-count for the feeders don't work with
the standard feed, but see the Iron Cross Weave, Spiral Weave or Twister Weave
for more 4-count weave variations.

### Hyper-Weave: Feeder 1-Count, Feedees 3-Count 

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | B       | C       | D       | B       | C       | D       |
| **B**       | A       |         |         | A       |         |         |
| **C**       |         | A       |         |         | A       |         |
| **D**       |         |         | A       |         |         | A       |

Ok, this is about as fast as a weave can get. It's really fast and really hard.
Throw really high lofty slow passes, move fast and hope for the best. If you can
do this weave, make sure you stop by Madison some time and do some fun juggling
with us!

Also see Mr. Inside Mr. Outside Weaves, Inside Out Weaves, Twister Weaves, etc.

There are a number of variations floating around where the weavers trade place
with the feeder (typically on one end only). Work it out.


### Dresser-Drawer Weave


|      |         |
|------|--------|
| ![](./media/image6.png){width=30%}   | ![](./media/weaveTable.png){width=35%}  |
|            | Right-hand counting |


This weave variation has the same passes as the standard weave, but the weavers
move side-to-side like dresser drawers  instead of through a figure eight. Usually we debate whether
B is the socks or underwear drawer.  Each juggler has its own slot (i.e. *drawer*)  to move on. Each slot has three positions: left,
middle, and right. Weavers move back and forth on their slots. Moves are made to
the next position after the pass is made from the current position.

![](./media/image7.png){width=70%}

The weave predates the MAJ. Seems like the Flying Karamozov's must have done it.
 We've been weaving since 1992.

### Inside-Out Weave
![](./media/image8.jpeg){width=40%}

Take the path of a standard weave -- a figure eight -- and
imagine warping space so that one of the loops shrinks a bit and is folded back inside the
other. That's the Inside-Out Weave.

The count and the passes are exactly the same as the standard weave, but the
jugglers move in a small loop from the new center (which is in the middle, but
has the count and movement for an end) to the “middle” (which is now on the
outside), and then in a large loop back (the other end) . In the loops always
move forwards for the “middle” (where C starts) and backwards from the “ends”
(where B and D are).

The passing lanes can be somewhat narrow, so be careful, or you might bruise
your ZOC.

Pattern by Mike Newton.

### It's a Good One

For a count challenge with no extra clubs, but in the standard weave formation,
the Feeder (A) passes 2 count, twice in a row to each feedee on each side. Feedees 
(B,C, D) throw: 2 throws of 2-count, 3-count transition, left-handed 4-count, 3-count transition, and repeat on other side. Set up with A facing B, C, D, with C in the middle,
moving forward and to the left.

### Gandini Weave

The Gandini Juggling Project has explored a lot of interesting weaves (see
Chapter 12 for more examples). We call any weave a Gandini Weave if the weavers
always pass in the middle of the figure 8 loop, although the Gandini's have
innovated many other interesting weaves besides just these variations. We  don't
know if that is what the Gandini's call them! This is a simple Gandini Weave
that is a great foundation for other patterns.

In this weave all the weavers move in a figure 8, but they always pass from the
middle instead of the end. To make the weave slow enough to be under control the
feeder will pass twice in a row to each mover.

The feeder is in 2-count (every right hand pass), the feedees throw 2 right hand
passes in a row, and then 4 right hand selves (PPSSSS).

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | B       | B       | C       | C       | D       | D       |
| **B**       | A       | A       |         |         |         |         |
| **C**       |         |         | A       | A       |         |         |
| **D**       |         |         |         |         | A       | A       |

It's easiest to start with the weavers stacked in a line all facing the feeder.
* The feeder (A) passes twice to the first weaver (B), then that weaver goes to
  the right.
* The feeder passes twice to the second weaver (C), then that weaver goes to the
  left.
* The feeder passes twice to the third weaver (D), then that weaver goes right.
* Now repeat where each weaver passes to the feeder and then moves in the
  opposite direction of the previous weaver.

This weave can be done in many interesting variations.
* Try adding an extra club and making all the passes as doubles, or passing
  chocolate bar.
* You can also invert the weave (reverse cascade).
* Try this weave in 6-count with only a single pass to each weaver if you want a
  challenge that will really make you break a sweat.

We learned about this family of weave variations from juggling with Sean Gandini
and the Gandini Juggling Project in 2000.

## Three Leaf Clovers 

The clover leaf patterns have a juggler on each *leaf*, and one
in the middle, all moving.  As the pattern  progresses, the juggler in the middle trades places with a juggler on
a leaf, *pushing* that juggler out of his/her leaf and back into the middle towards the next leaf in
the sequence, and passing along the way.  There are a different ways to make this work, but the following has become our default.

### Standard Clover

|------|--------|
| ![](./media/image9.jpeg){width=40%} | ![](./media/standardCloverTable.png){width=50%} |
|            | Right-hand counting |


In the standard version, there is a feeder who passes 3 times in a row (once to each
of the other jugglers; from right to left). Then the former feeder has 2 right hand selves to move
to the middle, one pass in the middle, and 2 right hand selves to move out of
the middle. Then the pattern repeats.  We say it's  *2-in-2-out*, as that counts the right selves on
the way through the middle.

To start, ignore the fact that there is a clover. Just concentrate on the feed,
and then moving into the middle of a feed and then moving out and repeating the
feed.  After the feed, as you start your *2-in*, it's helpful to move forward and slightly to the right while
simultaneously rotating to the right (clockwise, from above); this helps you open up to be ready to be the
middle pass in the next person's feed.

Just remember, feed, 2 selves-in-pass-2-selves-out. In the diagram above, A is the first
feeder. In 8 passes, the clover has completed a cycle where every juggler has
moved from their leaf to the next leaf.  A full cycle is 24 right-hand beats (3 leaves
times 8 beats per leaf).

 There's a beautiful symmetry to the pattern once it gets going. I hope you
enjoy it as much as we do!

Mike Newton created this pattern in 2000.

**Variations:**

Try it in 3-count or chocolate bar.  There are extensions that add clubs, people, 
and variations that change the passing sequence.

### Run Over Clover

The Run Over Clover is the same pattern (as the standard clover)  with some of the selves replaced with passes.

### Extra-Club Three Leaf Clover

This is the standard three leaf clover with an extra club added and all passes
as doubles. As usual, there are a number of ways to add a club. Here is a slower
version that is a little easier. The feeder passes twice to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
and 3<sup>rd</sup> feedees. The Hyper Clover is a faster and more elegant (but
much harder) relation.

All passes are right hand straight doubles. A right to left double self is
required to keep the timing.

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes only
> * A and C start with R
> * B and D start with L

Hmmm...this is the first time that pattern has been written down. It isn't
really as complicated as it looks. Let's walk one juggler through it.

1.  Feed from right to left in doubles. Pass once to the end, twice to the
    middle, twice to the other end.
2.  Self double, pause.
3.  Two right selves to move into the middle, then pass twice
4.  Self double, pause
5.  Two right selves to move out of the middle
6.  Repeat!

It's good fun if you're comfortable weaving while throwing doubles. Make sure
your double selves are high enough to maintain the timing of the pattern.

> * Both hands counting, all right hands are double passes or double selves
> * A starts with left hand
> * B starts with pause, then left hand (for start, B can just start with right
    self)
> * C starts with left hand
> * D starts with right hand and 4 clubs

It's a great pattern but quite challenging.

This was one of the first extra club clover variations we tried. (The first
attempt was me, Peter and Luke and Ilka from Luka Luka at a juggling
convention.) Peter, Luke and Ilka are all fantastic club passers, but we
discovered that this pattern was actually quite hard to do. That was the
motivation to create the slower version described previously. However, after
practicing and performing the Extra Club Clover for a few years, we were finally
able to learn the original variation too, now renamed to the Hyper-Clover.

Pattern by Luke Emery, 2001.

### Mike's Original Clover 

Here's another version of the 4 person clover. However, we juggle the Standard
Clover more often (which used to be called the New Clover) because it is easier
to remember and has a nicer flow to it. Local cycle is 8 beats and full cycle is 24.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | B       |         | D       |         | C       |         | D       |         |
| **B**       | A       |         | C       |         | D       |         | C       |         |
| **C**       | D       |         | B       |         | A       |         | B       |         |
| **D**       | C       |         | A       |         | B       |         | A       |         |

> * Right hand counting

Every juggler is a feeder passing a standard 4-count feed to the other 3
jugglers. Performed by Mad-5 at 1998 Madfest.

### Peter's Clover

The MAJ juggles the Standard Clover more often than this version. This is a nice
pattern, if you can remember the passing sequence.

| **Juggler/beat**   | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   | **9**   | **10**   | **11**   | **12**   |

| **A**         | B       | C       | D       | B       | D       | C       | B       | C       | D       | B        | D        | C        |
| **B**         | A       | D       | C       | A       | C       | D       | A       | D       | C       | A        | C        | D        |
| **C**         | D       | A       | B       | D       | B       | A       | D       | A       | B       | D        | B        | A        |
| **D**         | C       | B       | A       | C       | A       | B       | C       | B       | A       | C        | A        | B        |

> * Right handed 4-count

In the graph below, lines indicate passes, and arrows indicate the movement of
jugglers after the pass.

![](./media/image33.jpeg){width=50%}

Notice that the movement around the leaves in Peter's version is reversed from
Mike's original and Steve's version. (The starting positions are also different). It
takes 12 passes for everyone to move to the next leaf.

Every juggler is a feeder in a modified typewriter feed.


### Steve's Clovers

Here's another way to configure clover passes, though it hasn't garnered the adoraton
of the standard clover.



**Inside Passing Triangles**



| **Juggler/beat**   | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   |

| **D**         | C       |         | A       |         | B       |         | A       |         |

> * Right hand passing 4-count


**Outside Passing Triangles**


| **Juggler/beat**   | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

> * Right hand passing 4-count


**Alternate Inside/Outside Passing Triangles**

| **Juggler/beat**   | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

| **B**         | A       |         | C       |         | D       |         | C       |         |

> * Right hand passing 4-count

The movement graph below applies to the three versions above. Lines indicate
passes. Arrows indicate movement of jugglers after the pass.

![](./media/image35.jpeg){width=50%}

The passing rate and movement along the leaves is the same as in Mike's original version.
In Steve's version, for the odd numbered passes, A and D always pass to each
other, and B and C always pass to each other. For the even numbered passes,
three jugglers pass to each other in a triangle. The juggler not in the triangle
will be bumped off its leaf. You get three variations based on inside-only, outside-only,
or alternating passes.


## Spinny patterns 

### Benzene Ring (Four Juggler Version) 

There is a whole family of benzene ring patterns, where movers juggle in a
circle between two feeders. The Benzene Ring for Six and for Eight are 
easier patterns to learn, but Benzene Ring for Four is more fun.

This version is in 3-count. Now we usually call this Spinning 3-count.


|      |         |
|------|--------|
| ![](./media/image14.png){width=27%}   | ![](./media/4benzenetable.png){width=45%} |
|             | Both hands counting |
|             | Starting with right hand |
|             | Only passing beats shown |

After the first pass (throw \#1 in the graph, made with the right hand), A and B
have 2 self throws to turn around. If C and D make their right hand passes deep,
A and B will have an easier time turning.

 After the second pass (throw \#4 in the graph, made with the left hand), A and
B have 2 self throws to switch places. They switch places by moving around each
other in a counter clockwise direction.

After the 3rd pass (throw \#7 in the graph, made with the right hand), A and B
have 2 self throws to turn around.

After the 4th pass (throw \#10 in the graph, made with the left hand), A and B
have 2 self throws to switch places. The jugglers are at their original
positions. At this point, the pattern repeats.

This pattern is fast for the movers A and B because they are passing 3-count
while spinning around each other.

This pattern could be considered a 2-seated unicycle without the seats, going
backwards. It is a precursor for the Razor juggling pattern.

Pattern created July, 1997 by MAJ. Performed by Peter, Mel, Mike and Dan at Madfest 1998.

### Chocolate Stir

A chocolate bar variation of the 4 person Benzene Ring starts in the same
positions as the Benzene Ring. Each juggler is in chocolate bar. The inner
jugglers throw right pass, left pass, then right to left single and do a half
pirouette underneath, followed by a left self and then repeat.

> * The ½ P marks a half pirouette under a single spin right to left self.

Pattern by Luke Emery

## $2\pi/3$ With Post

Take the 3-person $2\pi/3$ pattern, but add a stationary *post* who feeds the same count as 
everyone else, but alternating to positions 2 and 5.


## Canoe

![](./media/image16.png){width=50%}

> * A is facing B, C, and D.
> * B, C, and D are facing A.
> * B and C pass dropbacks.
> * Use your favorite passing sequence.
> * Arrows indicate passes.

 We don't know who invented this pattern, but we have been doing it since 1993.
You can easily add extra clubs or people and use a variety of passing counts.

## Death from Above

This is a fun but challenging pattern with 2 extra clubs. It requires two
jugglers that are comfortable with 7 clubs 4-count back to back passing and who
aren't pansies like some Madison Area Jugglers I could mention.

A faces B, and C faces D.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | T-D     | S-B     |
| **B**       | T-C     | S-A     |
| **C**       | S-D     | T-B     |
| **D**       | S-C     | T-A     |

> * Right hand counting
> * A and B start with 4 clubs each and start passing at the same time. C and D
>   each start with 3 clubs.
> * A passes triple to D, then single to B.
> * B passes triple back-to-back to C, single to A.

## Two-on-Two Double 3-Count

Everyone does double 3-count feed, feeding from right to left. This pattern is a
prerequisite for El Nino \[see later\].

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | C       |         | D       |
| **B**       | D       | C       |         |
| **C**       | A       | B       |         |
| **D**       | B       |         | A       |

> * Both hands counting
> * Start with right-hand

This is the standard MAJ double 3-count box, but you might as well learn the
opposite version (feeding from left to right) for doing the backwards El-Nino
(La Nina).

\[dates to 7/97 MAJ, maybe earlier by others\]

## Ultimate Feeds


One count feeds are fun by themselves but they also provide a foundation for other
cool patterns, such as El Nino. 

### 12 club standard 1-count feeds


|    |     |        |
|----|-----|--------|
| ![](./media/1faces3.png){width=20%}   | ![](./media/typewriter1counttable.png){width=30%} | ![](./media/windshield1counttable.png){width=30%} |
|  |            | Both-hands counting |
|  |            | start with right |
|  | **typewriter**       | **windshield wiper** |


The typewriter form is 
a 3-count feed where A feeds a 1-count carriage return, and B, C, and D
are passing 3-count. The windshield-wiper form has C doing 2-count lefts and the other
feedees on 4-count rights. The typewriter can also be done backwards.

Not sure where these came from but we love them in Madison!

### Ultimate Feed Plus

Add one extra club to the Ultimate feed by having all the feedees throw crosses.
Alternatively (the feeder can throw crosses while the feedees throw straight).
The extra club feed can be done with many different spins.

All passes in singles. (Timing is a bit wonky. Throw a little outside,
especially on the middle throws.)

Feeder and feedees all in double passes. (Feeder rights synchronized with feedee
lefts.) Feels like 7 club 3-count.

Feeder in triples ultimates, feedees in singles. (Feeder rights synchronized
with feedee rights.)

Feeder in single ultimates, feedees in triples. (Feeder rights synchronized with
feedee rights.)

### Ultimate Feed Plus Plus

To add another club (14 total), throw all passes as doubles and all passes are
straight from both feeder and feedees.

Theoretically you could keep adding more clubs and higher throws, and just
switching back and forth from straight to cross feedee passes with each extra
club, but it gets challenging quickly.

## El Nino

 El Nino is a rotating 1 count feed and is one of the crown jewels of the MAJ
pattern book.

It is a challenging pattern, but quite doable once passers master the 1-count
feed and the 2 on 2 double 3-count box. And once you can juggle it, you can join
the Madison elite group of Jugglers Who Can Do The El Nino.

Positions: Lines indicate passes, arrows indicate movement of juggler after the
pass.

El Nino is the combination of 2 patterns: Two on Two Double 3-Count, and
Ultimate feed. Starting in the positions of the Ultimate Feed pattern, one of
the feedees moves across and stands next to the feeder. Now the jugglers are
doing Two on Two Double 3-Count.

Then another of the original feedees moves across, following the first mover,
and the pattern becomes the Ultimate Feed again.

Now have 2 jugglers move back (one at a time) to join the feeder. See the
diagrams above to see how the jugglers move.

The pattern in the graphs above is the fastest version. While learning, it's a
good idea to wait a while, until the next juggler is ready, before the next
move. Remember to move on a right hand pass.

The mirror image (1-count feeding left to right) is called La Nina. Move on left
throws instead of rights and start with a right pass in the middle.

There are other fun ways to rotate a 1-count feed. Tarim demonstrated a pattern
similar to 1-count El Nino where the mover transitions in 4-count instead of
3-count (leaving on a left hand throw in the above picture instead of a right,
and joining the double three count box on the opposite count. He also goes the
wrong direction like La Nina! :)

El Nino dates to August, 1997 by Peter Kaseman and MAJ, during the famous
[meteorological event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_El_Ni%C3%B1o_event) .

## El Nino Plus 

### Slow Version

![](./media/ElNinoPlusSlow.jpg){width=75%}

### Fast Version

![](./media/ElNinoPlusFast.jpg){width=75%}

El Nino patterns by Graham Paasch. **Q. Graham, where are the transitions?**

## El Turbo

A four-person turbo-fied version of El Nino.  The idea is to cross through the 
center of the pattern when you make your change-side, as in the Turbo.  It might
not be theoretically possible in 1-count (the rate for El-Nino), so we usually
do it in 2 count (right-handed).   The pattern has 16 passing beats, and we
usually count it 1-2-3-4 four times; each set corresponds to one person being
the feeder. For example, in the figure below, the red juggler starts as the feeder.  Notice, that beats 1 and 4 of each feed go to the same feedee.  
  You'll notice that the pattern is *chiral*, as we say, which means that it has a specific orientation; a backwards version would be different. In the figure, for example, movement through the middle always goes left to right.   


![](./media/el-turbo.jpg){width=70%}

**Variations:**
There are opportunities in El Turbo for 
 extra passes (compared to El Nino) that have become available owing to the crossing of jugglers.  These extra passes are noted with dashed grey lines in the figure above.   Of course they're not required, but they're cool.  There are also opportunities to pass to stationary jugglers on the left or right side of the pattern, making it a 5 or 6 person variant.  These extra jugglers pass 4 count; we
set the one on the right doing even beats:  pass to pink on beat 2,
 green on beat 4, blue on 6, and red on 8 [i.e. after they come through the
middle]. Then the passer on the left picks up the odd extra beats (e.g. green
on 1, blue on 3, red on 5).  Notice the left passer does two passes to one
side of the El Turbo and then two to the other side, all on 4 count.
Since the two stationary extra players are on alternating 4 counts they can
add an extra club triple over the top to each other. We tried this extra-club once but it didn't really work!!


## Tomahawk

This is an El Turbo variation.   Slow down the 2-count El Turbo base count to 3-count; then tomify
by replacing each *pass-self-self* with a *pass-pass-pass*.  It has nice club color coordination like 
Tom's Turbo. It's pretty heavy duty; e.g. as you cycle into your feeder position you end up
doing 1-count for 12 passes!
 
## Oogle Boogies 

Oogle Boogies are rotating Y patterns, with four jugglers passing multiple times then switching positions.

### Original Oogle Boogie 

**Positions and passing directions**

![](./media/image18.jpeg){width=75%}

For each box, the jugglers will throw 3 right hand passes (two count) followed
by a right hand self throw so they can move to the positions in the next box.
The arrows are the directions of the passes. For example, in box 1, A passes to
C, C passes to B, B passes to D, and D passes to A.

For the **Left Hand Version of Oogle Boogie**, use the same positions but
reverse the direction of all of the arrows and rearrange the order of the boxes
as 1,8,7,6,5,4,3, and 2.

For **Three Count Oogle Boogie**, use the positions in the diagram above.
Instead of the arrows, use the table below to determine where to pass. Notice
that the table below does not show beats 2,3,5,6,8,9, .... Assume that all beats
not in the table are self throws.

The first 3 passes, i.e. on beats 1, 4, and 7, are done in the positions in box
one above. The next 3 passes, i.e. on beats 13, 16, and 19, are done in the
positions in box two. Continue assigning 3 passes to each box. After the 4th
box, you will be at the end of the table below. For the boxes 5 through 8, start
again at the beginning of the table below.

|             |         |         |         |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **4**   | **7**   | **10**   | **13**   | **16**   | **19**   | **22**   | **25**   | **28**   | **31**   | **34**   | **37**   | **40**   | **43**   | **46**   |
| **A**       | C       | D       | C       |          | C        | C        | C        |          | C        | D        | C        |          | D        | D        | D        |          |
| **B**       | D       | C       | D       |          | D        | D        | D        |          | D        | C        | D        |          | C        | C        | C        |          |
| **C**       | B       | A       | B       |          | A        | A        | A        |          | B        | A        | B        |          | B        | B        | B        |          |
| **D**       | A       | B       | A       |          | B        | B        | B        |          | A        | B        | A        |          | A        | A        | A        |          |

Try the above in a 'pass, pass, self' pattern. Each box in the position table
will have 6 passes before changing positions for the next box. This is a
difficult pattern.

### Fast Oogle Boogie
Use only the position boxes 1, 3, 5, and 7, and follow
the passing directions indicated by the arrows. Remember to pass 3 times with
the right hand, using the 4th right hand self to switch positions. This is the
version we usually do.

Notice that the passes are always from A to C, B to D, C to B, and D to A.

When was this pattern created? We have been doing it since 1991; the Mad-5 performed it
at Madfest 1997.

### 14 Club Oogle Boogie

 This has the same movement sequence as the standard Oogle Boogie, but with 2
extra clubs so all the passes are doubles (like 7 2-count).

![](./media/image19.jpeg){width=75%}

Position 1: C, D start with 4 clubs each, do 3 passes, then triple self. A, B
start (1/2 beat after C and D) with 3 clubs each, do 3 passes, then move to
position 2.

Position 2: A, B do 3 passes , then triple self. C, D do 4 passes, then move to
position 3.

Position 3: A, B do 3 passes, then triple self. C, D do 3 passes, then move to
position 4.

Position 4: A, B do 4 passes, then move to position 5. C, D do 3 passes, then
triple self.

All passes are double spin passes. Four passes are needed to transfer the extra
clubs to the team that is not moving.

It's probably helpful to be comfortable with 7 club popcorn variations before
learning this pattern.

It's possible to do a regular fast Oogle Boogie instead of the slow version if
you have jugglers that are comfortable moving while throwing self triples.

Pattern by Luke Emery, 2000.

### Luke's Oogle

 This is a Y in 3-count. Odd numbers are right hand passes and even numbers are
left passes.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | C       | D       | C       | D       |
| **B**       | D       | C       | A       | A       |
| **C**       | B       | A       | D       | B       |
| **D**       | A       | B       | B       | C       |

> * 3-Count
> * Start with R
> * B does drop backs to A

If you have 4 jugglers that can do every position, then you can try the
following:

Four position graphs are depicted below. Starting with the first position,
perform 4 passes (one cycle) and use your 2-self throws to move to the positions
in the next graph. Four passes are made in every position.

The kind of rotation that the jugglers are doing in the variation above is the
same as in the fast Oogle Boogie pattern, also known as the rotating-Y.

Pattern created in 1998 by Luke Emery.

### Slingshot

This is a 14 club variation on the Y pattern (Oogle) where all of the right
hands are synchronized.

|             |         |         |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   |
| **A**       | C       | T-D     |
| **B**       | T-D     | C       |
| **C**       | A       | B       |
| **D**       | T-A     | T-B     |

Right hand counting

B and D start with 4 clubs each, and A and C start with 3 each.

D feeds A and B with 2-count triples (like 8 club 2-count).

C feeds A and B with 2-count singles (standard feed).

A and B alternate triple passes to D and single passes to C.

Every juggler is feeding two other jugglers: A and B are feeders to C and D,
and C and D are feeders to A and B.

By Peter Kaseman, 1999.

#### Slingshot Minus

Here's an easier version with only one extra club. All passes are in a 4-count.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | C       |         | T-D     |         |
| **B**       | T-D     |         | C       |         |
| **C**       | A       |         | B       |         |
| **D**       |         | T-A     |         | T-B     |

> * Right hand counting and passing
> * B starts with 4

#### Slingshot Plus

You can make the pattern more interesting by adding clubs in the middle. With
one more club C feeds an extra club line in doubles.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | D-C     |         | T-D     |         |
| **B**       | T-D     |         | D-C     |         |
| **C**       |         | D-B     |         | D-A     |
| **D**       | T-A     |         | T-B     |         |

> * Both hands counting
> * All passes with right hand
> * A, B and D start with 4 clubs and right hand
> * C starts with 3 clubs and left hand

#### Slingshot Plus Plus

Ok, while we're at it, you can add another club (so that all right hands are
triple passes) to get the following:

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | T-C     | T-D     |
| **B**       | T-D     | T-C     |
| **C**       | T-B     | T-A     |
| **D**       | T-A     | T-B     |

> * Right hand counting
> * All passes with right hand
> * All passers start with 4 clubs

This works best if all the jugglers are quite comfortable with 8 club 2-count in
triples.

Created June, 1999 by MAJ.

## Martin's Madness/Mildness

After we learned Martin's Madness, we put 4 jugglers in the positions shown and
tried to figure out if all 4 jugglers could be the feeder as in Martin's Madness
at the same time. The pattern below is what we ended up with.

| **Juggler/beat**       | **1**           | **2**           | **3**           | **4**           | **5**           | **6**           | **7**           | **8**           | **9**           | **10**          | **11**          | **12**          |

Notes:
* A and B are doing Martin's Mildness, out of sync. (straights)
* C and D are doing Martin's Madness, out of sync. (crosses)
* A and D are in sync, as are B and C.

Martin Frost created Martin's Madness and the variation on this page dates to
4/98 by MAJ. Martin has innovated many interesting feeds and other patterns,
often with hurries and zips. Look them up, or best of all, find a Stanford
juggler to help out.

Also see the 3 person Siteswap Feeds.

## Popcorn Feed

Recall that a popcorn pattern between 2 jugglers is a 7 club pattern where the
jugglers are passing a beat out of sync. With the right hand, each juggler
passes a double spin to partner, a single spin to self, and a triple spin to
self. The left hand throws are all single spin self throws.

The Popcorn Feed is a 14 club pattern where A is out of sync with B, C, and D.
A and B start with 4 clubs each, and B and C start with 3 each. A does a
typewriter feed in doubles. B, C, and D all do a standard 6-count popcorn.

|             |         |          |         |          |         |          |
|-------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**    | **3**   | **4**    | **5**   | **6**    |
| **A**       | D-D     |          | D-C     |          | D-B     |          |
| **B**       |         | D-A      |         | self     |         | T-self   |
| **C**       |         | self     |         | T-self   |         | D-A      |
| **D**       |         | T-self   |         | D-A      |         | self     |

> * Both hands counting
> * A starts with R and 4 clubs
> * C, D start with L
> * B starts with 4 clubs and a pause, then right throw on 2

This is a spectacular pattern, and could be a basis for an El Nino.

### Low Popcorn Feed

This feed can be done with single passes and double selves instead of doubles
and triples.

### Popcorn Weave

Like most feeds, this can be turned into a weave. The feeder throws windshield
wiper feed instead of typewriter feed. The feedees throw a triple self, then a
double pass, then move to the next weave position on their self. This is a
challenging weave. Also see the Popcorn Twister and Popcorn Twister Weave.

This pattern dates to September, 1999 by Luke Emery and the MAJ.

## Simple Egg Beater, No Handle


This is like a 4-person version of a synchronous double weave.

| positions                                       |    Right hand counting |


After the 4th beat, the jugglers are inverted, but the passing sequence repeats.

This pattern dates to 1997 by Mike Newton and MAJ, but it took us a while to recognize it is an egg-beater without a handle!

## Unicycle

The unicycle is a nice moving pattern in 3-count.

### 12 club

|   |  * All passes from B to A are drop-backs. |


Unicycle dates to 1996 by MAJ. Performed by Mad-5+1 at Madfest 1999.

### Unicycle Plus
![](./media/image26.png){width=30%}

This is a fun moving pattern in 4-count with triple passes,
double passes and dropbacks.

A feeds the left and right positions with 4-count triples.

B always throws dropbacks to A in 4-count.

C and D each throw 2 double passes to B in 4-count from the left position and
then the right position, and then have 4 right hand counts to move around the
back of the circle to the start.

## Y2K

![](./media/image27.png){width=30%}

This pattern has synchronous 1-count passes from A and synchronous dropbacks
from B to A. A and B throw simultaneously with the left and right hand. It might
take some practice to be comfortable catching those crazy passes!

 B starts with 4 clubs and passes 2 at a time to A.

A starts with 2 clubs and passes 2 at a time:

Right hand passes to C's left hand.

Left hand passes to D's right hand.

C passes every right hand to the "C" side of B (B's right hand) in right handed
2-count.

D passes every left hand to the "D" side of B (B's left hand) in left handed
2-count.

If B is facing C and D, then B passes simultaneous drop-backs to A, C passes to
B's right hand, and D passes to B's left hand.

At B's discretion, B will rotate and face A.

B will now pass 2 at a time straight to A.

C passes drop-forwards to B's left hand.

D passes drop-forwards to B's right hand.

Have B rotate in the pattern until dizzy, then switch positions so that everyone
has a chance to experience the problems associated with Y2K.

This pattern was created by Mike Newton on December 31, 1999.

## Gorilla for Four

This is one variation on gorilla passing with 4 passers.

There are 13 clubs. X starts with 4. A, B and C start with 3.

X throws synchronous ultimates. B throws right handed 2 count. A and C throw
right handed 4 count. Here is the pattern.

X starts by throwing synchronous ultimates to B's left hand and C's left hand.
Then X throws synchronous ultimates to A's left hand and B's left hand. And
repeat.

B starts a little after X's first throws, with a right hand throw to X's right
hand, then the next right hand throw is to X's left hand. In the steady state, B
alternates feeding X's right hand and X's left hand with 2 count right hand
throws.

C starts a little after X's first throw (in time with B) and throws to X's right
hand. After that, C is always doing 4 count with X's right hand.

A starts a little after X's first throw with a right hand self. After that, A
does 4 count with X's left hand.

## Rush and Rest

 This is a four-person pattern using right and left hand passing where each
juggler passes four out of six throws.

### Classic Rush and Rest

### Second Variation

A and B repeat the passing rhythm in the classic Rush and Rest. C and D pass for
two beats, rest for one beat.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |

Rush and Rest is by Steve Otteson and MAJ from 1998.

## Shooting Star

 In a Star pattern five jugglers stand in a circle and pass to the second
juggler to the right. A Shooting Star is a star with one juggler missing. When
each juggler runs out of clubs, they move to the empty space.

![](./media/image28.png){width=30%}

1.  A, C, and D start with 3 clubs and pass according to diagram one. When C
    runs out of clubs, C moves to the empty spot.
1.  A will run out of clubs next and then move to the empty spot. The pattern
    continues so that each juggler will run out of clubs and move to the empty spot.

**Tip:** Move to the center as you throw your last club after a club whizzes by
the front of your head. Turn around. Move out as the next pass whizzes by the
back of your head.

There are many variations on the shooting star. Add multiple clubs and up the
passes to doubles and/or triples. Pirouette through the middle

Shooting Star was created by Bryan Olson in 1993 (not in Madison!!).

## 14 Club Lines (for 4 jugglers)

 Here are some of the many 4 juggler line variations we do in Madison. A and B
are both facing C and D.

### Locked Lines

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | D-C     |         | D-C     |         |
| **B**       | D-D     |         | D-D     |         |
| **C**       |         | D-A     |         | D-A     |
| **D**       |         | D-B     |         | D-B     |

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes only
> * A and B start with 4 and right hand
> * C and D start with 3 and left hand

To avoid dangerous collisions, A and B should throw at exactly the same time,
and C and D should throw at exactly the same time. A and D can control the
timing the best since they have the best visibility.

### Popcorn Lines

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**    | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| **A**       |         | T-self   |         | D-C     |
| **B**       | D-D     |          | C       |         |
| **C**       | D-A     |          | B       |         |
| **D**       |         | T-self   |         | D-B     |

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes only
> * B and C start with 4 and right hand
> * A and D start with 3 and left hand

### Popcorn Lines 2

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       |         | T-D     |         | D-C     |
| **B**       | D-D     |         | C       |         |
| **C**       | D-A     |         | B       |         |
| **D**       |         | T-D     |         | D-B     |

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes only
> * B and C start with 4 and right hand
> * A and D start with 3 and left hand

You can switch back and forth between the Popcorn Line variations.

### Popcorn Dropback Line

The popcorn dropback variations work better if B and C move a little to the side
in more of a diamond formation than a line.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**    | **3**   | **4**   | **5**    | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **A**       | D-C     |          |         |         | T-self   |         |
| **B**       |         | T-self   |         | D-A     |          |         |
| **C**       |         | T-self   |         | D-D     |          |         |
| **D**       | D-B     |          |         |         | T-self   |         |

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes only
> * A and D start with 4 and right hand
> * B and C start with 3 and left hand and throw all dropbacks as doubles

### Popcorn Dropback Line 2

Now add triple passes over the top!

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | D-C     |         |         |         | T-D     |         |
| **B**       |         | T-C     |         | D-A     |         |         |
| **C**       |         | T-B     |         | D-D     |         |         |
| **D**       | D-B     |         |         |         | T-A     |         |

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes only
> * A and D start with 4 and right hand
> * B and C start with 3 and left hand and throw all dropbacks as doubles

To start, add one set of triple passes at a time.

### Popcorn Dropback Line 3

Ok, add in some more extra passes. Why not?

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | D-C     |         |         |         | T-D     |         |
| **B**       |         | T-C     |         | D-A     |         | C       |
| **C**       |         | T-B     |         | D-D     |         | B       |
| **D**       | D-B     |         |         |         | T-A     |         |

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes only
> * A and D start with 4 and right hand
> * B and C start with 3 and left hand and throw all dropbacks as doubles
