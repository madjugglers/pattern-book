# 7 Club Patterns

## Introduction

Peter Kaseman and I  had an experiment in winter 1999 to think up how many 7 club patterns we  could do. The goal was 100, and at first we thought that would be a difficult target. However we soon realized that there are so many possible site swap variations and tempo changes to easily pass 100. Not of all of them are easy to actually juggle though! Here are a few of them. 

## Catalog

**Chocolate Bars **

A: crossing double pass right, crossing double pass left, self, self.

B: straight single pass right, straight single pass left, straight double self, straight double self (starts with 4)

4p4p33 | 3px3px33

**4-count variations**

Here's a nice variation on 4-count triples in 7.

5p333533p3 | 335p33533p

In right hand counting: triple pass, single self, triple self, single pass.

**Pass, Pass, Shuffle**

5px5px1 | 4p4p1 (2<sup>nd</sup> juggler starts on beat 2)

A: triple cross, triple cross, shuffle.

B: pause, double straight, triple cross, shuffle.

**Another 6-count**

5p33334 | 3345p33

Crossing triple right, self, self, self, self, straight self double left

**Paired Siteswap Passing Patterns**

Any two siteswaps can be turned into passing patterns. For example, consider the 4 club siteswap 534 and the trivial 3 club siteswap 333. There are 12 different passing patterns from combining these two siteswaps. The juggler with the 534 can pass the 5, or the 3, or the 4, or the 5 and 3, 5 and 4, 4 and 3 or all of them. The juggler juggling the 3's just has to throw 1, 2 or 3 passes to match the timing of the first juggler. Then, we can switch all the straights to crosses and the crosses to straights to generate 6 more patterns (although 3 of them don't actually work because the two 3's collide if they are both crossing).

5p34 | 333p

53p4 | 33p3

534p | 3p33 (second juggler starts with 4)

5p3p4 | 33p3p

5p34p | 3p33p (second juggler starts with 4)

5p3p4p | 3p3p3p (second juggler starts with 4)

Crossing versions that work include:

5px34 | 333px

534px | 3px33 (second juggler starts with 4)

5px34px | 3px33px (second juggler starts with 4)

The same idea can be extended to any set of siteswaps with any number of items, such as 561 against 531 or 7441 against 7531. The simple siteswap 444 | 333 has a lot of nice passing variations. More complex siteswaps get challenging very quickly, though.

If the two jugglers have different numbers of clubs (for example 444 | 333), then they can switch sides with each other at almost any point by the first juggler throwing two passes in a row.

There is also a dual passing pattern variation of each of the above, as described earlier.

**Popcorns**

4-count: 3p353 | 533p3

5-count: 3.5p 3353 | 53 3.5p 33 (slight pause for 2<sup>nd</sup> juggler)

6-count: 4p33353 | 3534p33 (juggler 2 starts with left on these 6-count popcorn)

or 4p33344 | 3444p33 or 4p44144 | 1444p44 (skip 1 on start)

or 4p53153 | 1534p553 (skip 1 on start)

7-count: 4.5p 333353 | 353 4.5p 333

All even counted popcorns can also be juggled left-handed or with all crossing passes (one juggler left handed and the other right handed).

Now, to make things more interesting, all the popcorns can be juggled against either the next or previous versions in fast/slow. One juggler juggles fast, and the other slowly, so that they each complete a cycle at the same time. The odd count juggler always throws to the same side with alternating left and right passes (also alternating straight and cross passes). The even count juggler throws to each side in turn, also alternating straight and cross passes.

Try 7 club 1-count against 2-count, 2-count against 3-count, 3-count against 4-count, 4-count against 5-count, 5-count against 6-count and 6-count against 7-count.

All of the above patterns have Dual Passing Pattern variations, which tend to have a lot of ultimate single passes and some challenging synchronous variations. Try some and see.

4px5p3p4px5p3px | 3p3p3p3p3p3p (2<sup>nd</sup> juggler starts with 4)

4px33p3p4px4px | 3p4px4px4px33p (2<sup>nd</sup> juggler starts with 4)

4px33p3p | 3p4px53p

**Three Up**

Three Up is a 7 club 8 count popcorn pattern based on the 5551 siteswap with 4 clubs that Peter brought back from somewhere. As an incoming pass comes in, flash 3 crossing doubles (555), catch the incoming club, shuffle it from left to right and then pass it back as a single pass.

55513p333 | 3p3335551

It's technically possible to juggle this pattern with 8 clubs as 55514px | 4p5551 (the fives are doubles and the four is a single) but that's tough.

The 7-club version is more reasonable, and allows opportunity to play with all kinds of 4 club siteswaps. Try replacing the 5551 with 7441, 6631, 7531 and 5641.


## 7 Club 2-Count Exposed

Seven clubs is the playground for the serious club passer. Six clubs is easy. Eight is hard. Seven is just right.

So you know 7 club 2-count? That's great! But, wait, do you really? Let's take a closer look.

The standard 7 club 2-count consists of right handed passes as doubles and left handed single spin selves.

1.  4p3 | 34p

This pattern can of course be done with left handed passes too.

1.  34p | 4p3 left handed

By changing the height of the throws, the pattern can also be done with single spins.

1.  3.5p 3.5 | 3.5p 3.5

2.  3.5 3.5p | 3.5 3.5 left handed

Now, speaking of spins, all kinds of spin combinations are possible. One juggler can throw doubles while the other throws singles, or triples versus doubles. Even though the patterns are quite doable, that makes the timing a bit wonky. However, if one juggler throws triples while the other throws singles, then the timing locks in to a new simple siteswap. (Have the juggler passing single passes start with 4 and juggle with their right hands in sync with the juggler throwing triple passes.)

1.  5p3 | 3p3

2.  35p | 33p left handed

It's a curious and useful fact that any 7 club passing pattern can be modified by changing all the straight passes to crosses and all the cross passes to straights. This is actually applicable to all passing patterns, but for 6 and 8 club passing patterns many such variations lead to collision problems. For 7 club passing, however, a majority of the crossed patterns still work.

Each of the patterns we've discussed so far can also be juggled in a crossed version, where both jugglers cross passes. This means that one juggler will be making left hand passes (in 2-count) and the partner will be making right hand passes.

Crossed versions of above.

1.  Crossed version of doubles 2-count, both right and left handed: 4px3 | 34p.

2.  Crossed version of singles 2-count, both right and left handed: 3.5px 3.5 | 3.5 3.5px.

3.  Crossed version of triple/singles 2-count, both right and left handed: 5px3 | 3px3.

Because of symmetry, there are really only 9 unique patterns so far instead of 12. The left hand versions and the right hand versions turn into the same pattern when the jugglers cross passes.

As we've seen, every passing pattern has a corresponding complementary dual pattern (or shadow pattern) where a juggler's right hand pattern is combined with the left hand pattern off the adjacent juggler. This is really just one permutation of a 4 person 2 handed site swap. Each of the 9 patterns above has a corresponding shadow person pattern, and curiously, they are all 2-count, more or less. Let's look at a couple more closely.

1.  The shadow pattern for the standard 4p3 is a synchronous juggling pattern where the left and right hands of a juggler throw and catch at exactly the same time. For this pattern the left hand will throw a crossing double self while the right hand throws a straight single pass: (4x, 3p) | (4x, 3p). The second juggler pauses Â½ beat before throwing their 2 synchronous throws: one as a pass and the other as a self.

2.  The same pattern can be done left handed (3p, 4x) | (3p, 4x).

3.  If we change all the straight passes to crosses, then both 10 and 11 transform into the same pattern: (3px, 4x) | (4x, 3px).

The synchronous versions are very interesting 7 club 2-count patterns in their own right, and are a great foundation for epxloring other synchronous patterns. You can switch back and forth from left handed to right handed throws (still in 2-count, sort of) to make a fantastic 7 club pattern. One juggler will need to throw crosses while the other throws straights.

1.  Switching sync throws. (4x, 3px) (3px, 4x) | (3p, 4x) (4x, 3p).

This is in the same family as Will Murray's fantastic 7 club Scratch Your Head pattern, which is the same except the double self crosses and straights are switched.

1.  Scratch Your Head. (4, 3px) (3px, 4) | (4, 3p) (3p, 4).

That's still kind of a 2-count pattern!

The single spin version of seven 2-count doesn't change when you look at the associated dual pattern (7 1-count singles is the same way).

However, the triples/singles version makes an interesting set of dual pattern variations, still in 2-count!

1.  Fast lop-sided popcorn: 53p | 33p.

2.  Of course it can be done left handed: 3p5 | 3p3.

3.  And theoretically, with crossing passes: 53px | 33px. This one doesn't work too well, because there is a collision problem with the 2 crossing singles.

4.  And 20 again, with left hand self triples: 3px5 | 3px3. This one doesn't work very well either because of collisions.

Had enough? Well, there are more where those come from. Next, we look at combinations where one side does a synchronous pattern and the other does an asynchronous pattern. These are handy patterns when one juggler wants to try synchronous variations, but the other passer isn't ready for that yet.

1.  Here's the simplest: (3p, 4x) | 4p3.

2.  Now left handed: (4x, 3p) | 4p3 left handed.

3.  And, or course, crossing right handed: (3px, 4x) | 4px3.

4.  And crossing left handed: (4x, 3px) | 4px3 left handed.

Now try some variations where the extra clubs and synchronization are both on one side. They are asymmetric 2-counts, but that can be good if you have a mixture of passing skill levels.

1.  One juggler throwing both doubles synced (4p, 4x) | 3p3.

2.  And left handed (4x, 4p) | 33p.

3.  And crossing (4x, 4px) | 3px3.

4.  And crossing left handed (4px, 4x) | 33px.

There's a good start, but there are many many more without leaving 7 clubs with only doubles and single passes. Try some of these variations next time your passing partners says they're bored with 7 club 2-count.

So you know 7 club popcorn? That's great! But wait...do you really...?
