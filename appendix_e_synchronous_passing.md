#  Synchronous Passing

Hi Mandy,

Here is the 8 club version of the 7 club sync passing pattern I showed

you and Will at Millstreet.  I'm not quite ready for the 8 version at

the moment, but I think it will be a very beautiful pattern and I look

forward to seeing you show it to me next time we're at a convention

together!

A   B

A starts with 5 clubs (3 in right, 2 in left), B with 3 (2 in right, 1

in left).  Every throw is a pass and each passer has their left and

right throws synchronized.  Here's the text description rather than the

siteswap.

A throws synchronized right triple straight, left single cross

B responds ½ beat later

B throws synchronized right single straight, left triple cross

A throws synchronized right single cross, left triple straight

B throws synchronized right triple cross, left single straight

Repeat until you get bored.  :)

Interestingly enough, 3 clubs always do singles and 5 clubs always do

triples, which might make color coordinating the clubs useful.

Technically it seems to work out to be 5 club 1 count with triples

synchronized with a 3 club 1 count as singles.

A number of people wrote to ask me about the 7 club version of that 8 club sync pattern, which I probably should have just included. Anyway, here it is, as well as some others.

The first juggler has the same sequence, while the second responds in synchronous ultimate singles.

A B

A starts with 4 clubs (2 in right, 2 in left), B with 3 (2 in right, 1in left). Every throw is a pass and each passer has their left and right throws synchronized.

A throws synchronized right triple straight, left single crossing

B responds 1/2 beat later

B throws synchronized right single straight, left single straight

A throws synchronized right single crossing, left triple straight

B throws synchronized right single straight, left single straight

I haven't actually tried the 8 club version myself yet, but the 7 club version is challenging enough. Although one side just throws singles, they have to catch a triple and a single pass at the same time on every beat, and that can be tricky...at least for me. As a variation, it

should also work for A to throw the other side of the 8 pattern with crossing triples and straight singles. B would do the same as before, except B would then start with 2 in the left hand and 1 in the right.

If you are interested in 7 club synchronous passing patterns, here are some easier ones to start with.

A B

One sync pattern is just 7 club 3 count in all single spins, which has an interesting, if choppy, sync rhythm.

Basic 7 club synchronous right handed:

A throws synchronous left hand crossing double self, right hand straight single pass.

B responds 1/2 beat later with the same.

Repeat.

Of course, you can do the same pattern with left handed passes and right double selves.

Then, if you're feeling up to it, you can switch back and forth from left handed to right handed sync passing on each cycle to make another fun but challenging pattern, as follows:

A right pass single straight, left self double crossing

B (responds with) right pass single straight, left self double straight

A right self double crossing, left pass single straight

B right self double straight, left pass single straight

I came up with that quite a few years ago when I (with Peter) worked out a list of 100 passing patterns for 7 clubs. It is somewhat similar to Will and Rhonda's Scratch Your Head pattern, which I had never seen, (though I heard rumors about it), until I tried it for the first time in

Millstreet. For some reason it seems to me that the synced crossing self doubles are easier than the synced straight self doubles.

I believe Will already has a good description of the synchronous Scratch Your Head pattern somewhere else, but here it is anyway:

A right pass single straight, left self double straight

B (responds with) right pass single crossing, left self double straight

A right self double straight, left pass single straight

B right self double straight, left pass single crossing

It's nice and I'd like to get the Scratch Your Head pattern down solid now that I've learned how to do it, so I'm planning to work on that here.

Hmmm, the thought occurs to me that you may be able to switch back and forth between Scratch Your Head and the previous pattern (which I think needs a name...) at any time, just by throwing a cross single pass and straight double self instead of a cross double self and straight single pass.

Also, I just noticed that Scratch Your Head has a similar quality to the 8 club sync pattern, in that 4 clubs always do doubles and 3 clubs always do singles. It's a 4 club pattern (all self straight doubles, site swap 4) superimposed on 3 club 1 count instead of a site swap 5 superimposed on a 3. They're sister patterns!

Very cool.

Anyway, I hope that's interesting to anyone who likes 7 club sync passing...
