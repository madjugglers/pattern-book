# 5-Person Patterns

## Apollos 

### Original Apollo

The original Apollo (also known as the 1-1-3 Apollo) is an MAJ standard.


|                                        |                          |
|------------|------------|
| ![](./media/apollopositions.png){width=15%} | ![](./media/apollo5table.png){width=35%} |
| positions                                       |    Right-hand counting |


### Cockeyed Apollo

Change the outside throws to be in a Y and the Apollo becomes cockeyed...so
named because the middle feeder (B) has to throw and catch from opposite
directions. Notice the switcheroo in the passing table for jugglers C and E.

|                                        |                          |
|------------|------------|
| ![](./media/apollopositions.png){width=15%} | ![](./media/capollotable.png){width=35%} |
| positions                                       |    Right-hand counting |


### Apollo Plus

A and D can pass an extra club (triple spin) over the pattern on their right
hand self throw. D starts with the extra club.  This variation works well with the standard Apollo, but is hair raising with the
Cockeyed Apollo.  If that's not exciting enough, add another club to the inner feed (all those
passes are doubles) so it is a 2-count extra club feed.

### Apollo Plus Weave

Here's a nice weave pattern (see later for more  on weaves). 
Start with the 1-1-3 Apollo formation and have B feed a standard weave of C, D and E. Then A can add an extra club and throw
4-count triples to the ends. (A starts with 4 and a triple to whichever end B
doesn't start with.)

All the weavers will have the following sequence (starting from the outside) B,
self, self, B, self, Triple to A, B.

Also see the 1-2-3 Apollo for 6 jugglers and the 1-2-4 Apollo for 7 jugglers.

The Apollo was invented by N.A.S.A. The Apollo juggling pattern was invented by
the Gemini Jugglers in 1991.

## Chocolate Feeds 

These are fun 5 person stationary patterns, with 2 feeders and 3 feedees, originally
in opposing lines (standard positions) or in the more uncomfortable wedgee positions, which used 
to work well when we juggled on chairs in 3650 Humanities!

|                        |

### Chocolate Bar 3-Count Feed

The Chocolate Bar 3-count  feed shares a 1-count feed between two feeders. 


| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A**       | C     | D     |       |       | D     | E     |       |       | E     | C      |        |        |
| **B**       |       |       | E     | C     |       |       | C     | D     |       |        | D      | E      |
| **C**       | A     |       |       | B     |       |       | B     |       |       | A      |        |        |
| **D**       |       | A     |       |       | A     |       |       | B     |       |        | B      |        |
| **E**       |       |       | B     |       |       | A     |       |       | A     |        |        | B      |

> * Both hands counting, right hand starts

Aidan Quinn worked out an extra club variation of this pattern. See his web site
under the Passing Resources section for more information. Basically the feeders
share an extra club ultimate feed, alternating two passes as chocolate bar.
Feeders pass straight and feedees pass cross.

A version with 2 extra clubs should be theoretically possible, with all passes
straight doubles.

This pattern is also called the Chocolate Box. 
See [](https://www.juggle.org/passing-post-feeding-on-chocolate-bars/)

Pattern by Steve Otteson and MAJ; performed by Mad-5 at 1997 Madfest and elsewhere.

### Double Chocolate Double 3-Count Feed

Another pattern using the 2-facing-3 or wedgee positions.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | C     | C     | D     |
| **B**       | E     | D     | E     |
| **C**       | A     | A     |       |
| **D**       |       | B     | A     |
| **E**       | B     |       | B     |

> * Both hands counting
> * Right hand starts

Notice that the first 3 throws are R-L-R, and the next 3 throws are to the same
people but are L-R-L.

Pattern by Steve Otteson and MAJ. Performed by Mad-5+1 at 1999 Madfest.

### Semi-Sweet Chocolate 3-Count Feed  (The New One)

As far as the number of passes made by A and B go,the Semi-Sweet pattern is in between the Chocolate Bar and the Double Chocolate Bar patterns. Also uses the 2-facing-3 or wedgee positions.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | E     | C     |       | E     | D     |       |
| **B**       |       | D     | C     |       | E     | C     |
| **C**       |       | A     | B     |       |       | B     |
| **D**       |       | B     |       |       | A     |       |
| **E**       | A     |       |       | A     | B     |       |

> * Both hands counting, right hand starts

In early versions of the passing book this was called *The New One*. Pattern by Mike N.

#### Variation

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

## Circles

There are lots of cool stationary patterns for five jugglers who are arranged equi-spaced
around a circle.

![](./media/circle.png){width=30%}

### Feast (for 5 jugglers)

Everyone feeds everyone else!

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | C     | D     | E     |       |
| **B**       | A     |       | C     | D     | E     |
| **C**       | E     | A     | B     |       | D     |
| **D**       |       | E     | A     | B     | C     |
| **E**       | C     | D     |       | A     | B     |

> * Any count of your choosing.

Classic pattern. When were these patterns created? We have been doing them since
1992. Already this generalizes the standard Rotating Feed (which is not marked up here; we don't usually do it).

**Variation:** When on 3-count, try to **Picnic**.  I.e., do one cycle on straight
throws and the next on crossing throws.  This creates some crazy Jim's jams.

### Extra Club Rotating Feed

Any feed or feast can be done with an extra club by throwing passes as doubles
and following every feedee pass and every feeder cycle with a self double to
restore the timing. A right to left self double switches left and rights.

This pattern is also in a star. A is the first feeder. This feed is shown
clockwise, but of course it could work either direction.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**  | **2**  | **3**  | **4**  | **5**  | **6**  | **7**  | **8**  | **9**  | **10** | **11** | **12** | **13** | **14** | **15** |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A**       | D-C    |        | D-D    |        | D-E    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-D    |        | D-self | Pause  |
| **B**       |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-E    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-D    |        |
| **C**       |        | D-A    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-E    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        |
| **D**       |        |        |        | D-A    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-A    |        | D-B    |        | D-C    |
| **E**       | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-B    |        | D-C    |        | D-D    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |
| **Juggler** | **16** | **17** | **18** | **19** | **20** | **21** | **22** | **23** | **24** | **25** |        |        |        |        |        |
| **A**       |        |        |        | D-C    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |
| **B**       | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-D    |        | D-E    |        | D-A    |        |        |        |        |        |
| **C**       | D-E    |        | D-A    |        | D-B    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |
| **D**       |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-B    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        |        |        |
| **E**       |        | D-C    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |        |        | D-B    |        |        |        |        |        |        |

> * Both hands counting, all right hand passes are doubles
> * A starts with 4 clubs
> * A and E start with right hand
> * B, C and D start with left hand

The steady state right hand sequence is feed 3 passes, double self, then the
sequence self, pass, double self, self two times. Repeat.

Pattern by Luke Emery, 1999.

### Extra Clubs Feast

The feast is an extension to the 5 juggler feast and the 5 juggler Extra Club
Rotating Feed. The feeders alternate straight across right hand triples and
doubles to keep the timing working.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | Pause |       | D-E   |       | T-C   |
| **B**       |       | T-D   | Pause |       | D-A   |
| **C**       |       | D-B   |       | T-E   | Pause |
| **D**       | T-A   | Pause |       | D-C   |       |
| **E**       | D-D   |       | T-B   | Pause |       |

> * Both hands counting, all right hands are double or triple passes
> * D and E start with 4 clubs and right hands
> * On the very start only, A skips the pause and starts with a D-C on 1 with
    right hand
> * B and C start with left hand

Wow. Remember, if it were easy, then anyone could do it...

If that is just too crazy, then you can do the same pattern idea slower.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**  | **2**  | **3**  | **4**  | **5**  | **6** | **7** | **8**  | **9** | **10** |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| **A**       | D-C    |        | D-C    |        | D-D    |       | D-E   |        | D-E   |        |
| **B**       |        | D-self | Pause  |        | D-C    |       | D-D   |        | D-D   |        |
| **C**       |        | D-A    |        | D-B    |        | D-B   |       | D-self | Pause |        |
| **D**       |        | D-E    |        | D-A    |        | D-A   |       | D-B    |       | D-C    |
| **E**       | D-D    |        | D-D    |        | D-self | Pause |       | D-A    |       | D-B    |
| **Juggler/beat** | **11** | **12** | **13** | **14** | **15** |       |       |        |       |        |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| **A**       | D-self | Pause  |        | D-B    |        |       |       |        |       |        |
| **B**       | D-E    |        | D-A    |        | D-A    |       |       |        |       |        |
| **C**       | D-D    |        | D-E    |        | D-E    |       |       |        |       |        |
| **D**       |        | D-C    |        | D-self | Pause  |       |       |        |       |        |
| **E**       |        | D-B    |        | D-C    |        |       |       |        |       |        |

> * Both hands counting, all right hands are double passes or double selves
> * A and E start with 4 clubs and right hands
> * B,C and D start with left hand

Heres another related pattern that might be easier than the first.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       |       | T-D   | Pause |       | D-D   |
| **B**       |       | D-E   |       | T-E   | Pause |
| **C**       | T-A   | Pause |       | D-A   |       |
| **D**       | D-B   |       | T-B   | Pause |       |
| **E**       | Pause |       | D-C   |       | T-C   |

> * Both hands counting, all right hands are double or triple passes
> * D and C start with 4 clubs and right hands
> * On the very start only, E does a pause on 1 and then a left self on 2
> * A and B start with left hand

Patterns by Luke Emery, 1999.




There are lots of patterns involving 5 jugglers equally spaced around a circle, and where the
 passing lines form an iconic 5-pointed star. 

![](./media/star.png){width=30%}

### Basic Star


| **Juggler/beat** | **R** | **L** |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | D     | C     |
| **B**       | E     | D     |
| **C**       | A     | E     |
| **D**       | B     | A     |
| **E**       | C     | B     |

> * The passing table indicates an odd count, so that right passes go to the right side and lefts go to 
 the left  side
> * If an even count (right-handed), then only pass to the person 2 spots around to your right.

This is for 5 jugglers what a box is for 4 jugglers.    The passes are syncronous, so there's collision
potential unless people are well timed.

Classic pattern.

### Selfless Star

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | C     | D     | E     |
| **B**       | C     | D     | E     | A     |
| **C**       | D     | E     | A     | B     |
| **D**       | E     | A     | B     | C     |
| **E**       | A     | B     | C     | D     |

> * 3-count

You can extend this pattern to 2 of 3-count or even 1-count if you're feeling
ambitious (rights and lefts always go to opposite sides). Good luck with that.

When was this pattern created? We have been doing it since 1992.


### Feast-Star

This is a fun brain game.  You alternate passes of a star and of a feast!!



### Extra-Club Stars

There are lots of nice variations on a star with extra clubs. If you're
comfortable with 7 and 8 club passing patterns using left and right passes, try
these.

#### 4-Count Extra Club Star

In this straight forward variation, each juggler passes in a 4-count across and
to the right. This pattern has only right hand passes and right to left double
selves.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**  | **2**  | **3**  | **4**  | **5**  |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A**       | D-D    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |
| **B**       | Pause  |        | D-E    |        | D-self |
| **C**       |        | D-self | Pause  |        | D-A    |
| **D**       |        | D-B    |        | D-self | Pause  |
| **E**       | D-self | Pause  |        | D-C    |        |

> * Both hands counting
> * A starts with 4
> * A, E start with right
> * B, C, D start with left (B starts with a Pause, so B actually starts with a
    right on beat 2)

#### 5-Count Extra Club Star

This is an extension of the 3-count extra club triangle. Each juggler passes
doubles in 5 count across and to the right. All passes cross (rights to right,
lefts to left).

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | D-D   |       |       |       |       |
| **B**       |       |       | D-E   |       |       |
| **C**       |       |       |       |       | D-A   |
| **D**       |       | D-B   |       |       |       |
| **E**       |       |       |       | D-C   |       |

> * Both hands counting
> * A starts with 4

All jugglers start with right hand

#### PSPSS Star

We can continue to add clubs and passes to the 5-Count star, until it is a
1-Count star with 20 clubs and all throws are crossing double passes. However,
that is really hard.

Here's a nice variation that is challenging but very doable and looks great. The
key to this pattern is precise timing. There are two doubles crossing the circle
on every beat and the timing must be exact so they don't collide. If there is
any variation, throw the first pass a little late and the second pass a little
fast.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

### Triply Star

In this star a triple pass goes around the pattern. Single passes take up the
extra time.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | T-D   |       |       | C     | D     |
| **B**       | D     | E     | T-E   |       |       |
| **C**       |       |       | E     | A     | T-A   |
| **D**       | B     | T-B   |       |       | A     |
| **E**       |       | B     | C     | T-C   |       |

> * Right-hand counting
> * A starts with 4

If you want to get crazy, note that each juggler has 2 right selves in a row.
That's exactly enough time for each juggler to do a triple self with a pirouette
and stay in time.

If you need to mellow it out, you can remove all the single passes and just pass
a triple around in 10-count.

Here's another variation with triple selves instead of triple passes.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**  | **2**  | **3**  | **4**  | **5**  |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A**       | T-self | D      |        | C      | D      |
| **B**       | D      | E      | T-self | E      |        |
| **C**       | A      |        | E      | A      | T-self |
| **D**       | B      | T-self | B      |        | A      |
| **E**       |        | B      | C      | T-self | C      |

> * Right-hand counting
> * C starts with 4

There could be many more interesting star variations based on siteswaps that are
passed from one star point to the next. I've seen a few demonstrated at European
conventions.

Pattern by Luke Emery.

### 20 Club Star

 This classic pattern is just a star where every juggler starts with 4 clubs
and does 2-count doubles to the juggler across and to the right.

It's a good study in timing.


### Twirly Star

Here's a fun variation on the Shooting Star (4-person pattern), but with 5 people and
less moving.


| **Juggler/beat** | **1**     | **2**     | **3**     | **4**     | **5**     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **A**       | D         | D         | Pirouette | D         | D         |
| **B**       | E         | E         | E         | E         | Pirouette |
| **C**       | A         | Pirouette | A         | A         | A         |
| **D**       | B         | B         | B         | Pirouette | B         |
| **E**       | Pirouette | C         | C         | C         | C         |

> * Right-hand counting, 2-count
> * E starts with 2 clubs

Make sure to keep the count after the pirouette! (At first you can just pause
for 2 counts instead of pirouetting.) You'll pirouette holding 2 clubs.

Pattern by Luke Emery.


### Stationary Isla Vista Weave

In this circle pattern a 2-count feed travels around the circle.  No juggler passes to either of their adjacent neighbors. The first table shows the 2666 variation which is a good introduction to those new to the pattern. (This is not an MAJ pattern.)

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** |

But for those seeking a more challenging pattern, here's a 2454 variation:

And for even more challenge, try doing the 1333 variation:

> * Both hands counting

## Up-Up-Over-5 

Refer to Up-Up-Over for 3 jugglers; recall this one involves simultaneous double
throws from both hands.  Expand from 2 facing 1  to 3 facing 2 jugglers.  Now only the outside jugglers
on the line do Up-Up-Over; the other three are Over-only feeders.  Remember, these are 
simultaneous (right and left) double throws.

## Gauntlet

This is an easy but need-to-pay-attention moving pattern, which the Cool Guyz used once  to  exit the Madfest stage. It's a 5-person 4-count. On each passing beat one juggler (yellow nodes in figure) has 2 clubs (and doesn't pass).  These occur
twice in a row for each juggler, as he/she moves through the middle and waits to receive a pass at the *bottom* of the pattern.   The leader calls out *down*, *box*, *down*, 
*box* on passing beats, and the passes and movements are as in the figure..

![](./media/gauntlet.jpg){width=85%} 


## Mr. Inside-Mr. Outside Weave

This modifies the standard weave by  dividing the feeder into two feeders (one
passing on the inside and one on the outside), both on 4-count in the standard version. 
It's  a good warm up pattern
for the Twister Weave (see below). 


|                                        |                          |

| positions                                       |    Right-hand counting |


Juggler A is also called Glen Davis (Mr. Outside), and Juggler B is Doc Blanchard (Mr. Inside), for
reasons that none of us recall, though Tom Pomraning insisted on the names.  Movements of
the weavers are identical to the Standard Weave, though passes go alternatively to the two
feeders. 

![](./media/image37.png){width=55%}

The same variations for the standard weave and the Twister Weave can be used for
this pattern, but there are some others. For example, Jugglers A and B can set up on a line
perpendicular to the weave, with A (outside) further from the weave.  We have been doing it since at least 1994, but are not sure of its origin.  


## Twister Weaves 
![](./media/image38.jpeg){width=30%}

The original Twister Weave is perhaps one of our greatest discoveries. 
It has the exact same passing table as the Mr. Inside Mr. Outside Weave.
However, Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside are on opposite sides of the weavers, so the
feedees turn around after every pass. When we first tried this on Library Mall (August 24, 1992),
it seemed incredibly hard, probably because we hadn't yet mastered moving patterns involving rotations; Oogle Boogies and other weaves had moves but no rotations; Egg Beaters had 90 degree rotations; Quincunx had a full rotation but it was very slow.  Good self throws make the difference! 


### Original Twister Weave 

Count: Feeders 4-Count, Feedees 6-Count moving. 

Simply, take the Mr. Inside Mr. Outside weave from above, retain the passing
sequence as given but put the feeders on opposite sides of the weave.


Alternatively, each weaver passes once on the end to Mr. Outside (X), and then has a 6-count (2 right hand selves) to move to the inside and turn around. Then pass once to Mr. Inside (Y) and continue in a 6-count outside and then turning around.

The turns may be done by turning towards the inside or towards the outside. Most people find inside turns easier in the middle and on the ends (i.e. back away from the current feeder and then turn towards the new feeder). However, we suggest that you learn both turns and see which combinations you like best.

### 3-Count Twister Weave 

Count: Feeders 3-count, Feedees alternate 5-count, 4-count, moving

For unbalanced weaves (where the weaver does a different count going inside-out
than outside-in) it generally seems easier to do the more challenging count (the
smaller one) on the outsides.

### Hyper-Twister Weave 

Count: Feeders 2-count, Feedees 3-count, moving

This is a master-class pattern, owing to 180 degree turns after every pass and on 3-count.
Good leads are essential!

There are lots of variations on the Twister Weave. See the Twister Plus, Double
Time Twister, etc.

We can add 2 clubs to the standard Twister Weave and make the passes from X and
Y to the weavers be triples (7 club 4-count between each side of the weave and
the feeder), and the return passes triples too.

Another variation is to add 2 extra clubs and have the feeders do 4-count in
fast popcorn (534p3).

Try the twister weave in chocolate bar too.

Original Twister Weave suggested by Mike Newton. Variations by MAJ.

### Twister Plus

In this beautiful variation of the Twister Weave the feeders replace their right-hand
selves with triple passes back and forth over the top of the weave, in 7-club 4-count style.
 The weaving pattern is exactly the same as the Original Twister Weave.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **X**       | A       | T-Y     | C       | T-Y     | B       | T-Y     |
| **Y**       | T-X     | B       | T-X     | A       | T-X     | C       |
| **A**       | X       |         |         | Y       |         |         |
| **B**       |         | Y       |         |         | X       |         |
| **C**       |         |         | X       |         |         | Y       |

> * Right-hand counting
> * Y starts with 4

Another nice variation is for the weavers to do ½ pirouettes under a triple
right to left self throw for their turn.

Also see Twister++ and Twister 5.

Pattern by MAJ.

### Double Time Twister

The Double-time Twister is the same as the Twister Weave with each weaver
passing twice to each feeder before turning around to pass twice to the other
feeder. Now each feeder is passing 2-count: passing twice to each weaver as they
go by.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **X**       | A       | A       | C       | C       | B       | B       |
| **Y**       | C       | B       | B       | A       | A       | C       |
| **A**       | X       | X       |         | Y       | Y       |         |
| **B**       |         | Y       | Y       |         | X       |         |
| **C**       | Y       |         | X       | X       |         | Y       |

> * Right-hand counting

For each weaver that A passes to, the first pass is made when the weaver is on
the outside. The weaver moves to the inside, following the arrows, for the
second pass. A is Mr. Outside In.

For each weaver that B passes to, the first pass is made when the weaver is in
the inside. Then the weaver moves to the outside, following the arrows, for the
second pass. B is Mr. Inside Out.

To see what the weavers do, lets look at what A does. A passes to X in the
outside position and then moves to the inside where the next pass is made to Y.
A has one right hand self throw to turn around and make the first throw to Y.
The first pass to Y is made when A is on the inside. A then moves to the outside
to make the second pass to Y and has one self throw to turn around and repeat
the pattern.

All weavers do the same thing two passes out of phase.

Pattern created by MAJ.

### Double Time Twister Plus

Here is a twister variation with 2 extra clubs where the passes to and from the
weave are all doubles like an extra club feed.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **X**       |       | D-A   |       | D-C   |       | D-C   |       | D-B   |       | D-B    |        | D-A    |
| **Y**       |       | D-B   |       | D-B   |       | D-A   |       | D-A   |       | D-C    |        | D-C    |
| **A**       | D-X   |       | D-X   |       |       |       | D-Y   |       | D-Y   |        |        |        |
| **B**       |       |       | D-Y   |       | D-Y   |       |       |       | D-X   |        | D-X    |        |
| **C**       | D-Y   |       |       |       | D-X   |       | D-X   |       |       |        | D-Y    |        |

> * Both hands counting
> * A and C start with 4
> * A, B and C start with right hand
> * X and Y start with left hand

### Twister Popcorn

The Twister Popcorn is the same as the Popcorn Feed except there are 2 feeders,
one on each side, and each popcorn feedee passes to one, turns to pass to the
other, and repeats. The feedees do not weave in this pattern. That's the next
pattern. In this pattern they just turn in place. The feeders do a Typewriter
Feed.

|                                        |                          |
|------------|------------|
| ![](./media/image39.jpeg){width=35%} | ![](./media/twisterpopcorntable.png){width=60%} |
| positions                                       |    Right-hand counting |


The hardest position is the middle feedee, because he/she cannot cheat as much
into the turns. You can either turn fast during the single self, throw a right
to left single straight up in the air and do a ½ pirouette underneath it, or
throw a behind the back self to turn.

> * X and C start with 4
> * A, B and C are 1 beat after X and Y

It's probably best to be quite comfortable with popcorn feeds before spending a lot of time on this pattern.

Pattern by Luke Emery.

### Involuting Twister Weave

This variant has the feeders and feedees constantly swapping places with each other after they complete a pass.  This results in everyone passing on an alternating 4-count, 6-count passing pattern.  The jugglers' movements trace out the shape outlined below with arrows indicating direction of movements:

![](./media/involution.png){width=50%}

The jugglers will need to pay attention though, as they alternate which semicircle they go around.  In other words, each juggler traces out an elongated figure 8.  Below follows a tabular recording of the passing pattern, along with an accompanying positional diagram.

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **X**       |         | B       |         |         | A       |
| **Y**       | C       |         |         | B       |         |
| **A**       |         |         | C       |         | X       |
| **B**       |         | X       |         | Y       |         |
| **C**       | Y       |         | A       |         |         |

> *  Right hand counting only, all right hand passes.

![](./media/involuting_twister.png){width=100%}

Notice that the pattern is only 5 beats long while it takes a total of 20 passing beats to return each juggler to their starting position.

Pattern created by Mike Newton and Melonhead August 2022. 

## Isla Vista Weave

This is the same passing pattern as the Stationary Isla Vista Weave, but instead of a circle, the jugglers start in two rows facing each other: a top row of 3 jugglers and a bottom row of 2 jugglers.  The bottom row positions take turns doing a 2-count feed while rotating through a figure 8 shape.

The figure below shows the general motion, the arrows indicate the 2-count feeds:

![](./media/isla_vista.png){width=100%}



## Four-Leaf Clover

So the deal with clover patterns is that the number of jugglers is one more than the number of leaves; there's
always one juggler on each leaf and one extra in the middle, about to swap places with one of the leaves. This 
is a very pleasant 5 person moving pattern; all jugglers do the same thing in the steady state: feed three (right to left); 2-selves to move into middle; pass in middle; 4 selves to get out.  That's a *2-in-4-out*, in
contrast to the *2-in-2-out* three-leaf clover for four jugglers.  Each juggler's job repeats after 10, but the
whole pattern takes 40 rights to complete.

|                                        |                          |

![](./media/image42.jpeg){width=50%}

**Variations:**  

It's fun to try different counts, such as on a 3-count base instead of a 2-count base.

See all of those self throws? Well, you can fill some of them in by adding another pass on every beat.

## Chocolate Swirl

The chocolate swirl is a moving extension of Double Chocolate Double Three
Count. It is noteworthy for jugglers moving from one side of the pattern to the
other with only a single self throw. That is possible. It is also noteworthy for
being hard, both to remember and to juggle.  The table shows a single transition where E moves to the other side.

|                                        |                          |

|                                          |  Right hand starts |



Once you get comfortable with one transition at a time, then you can run the
transitions faster. Or so we imagine...we've never been that comfortable!

## Mango Swirl/Mangled Squirrel

* 5 jugglers: all good with 7-club 2-count passing and moving

* Positions: 2 facing 3, as above in Chocolate Swirl

* Continuously, juggler on end of 3-line switches sides creating flipped 2-facing-3


The Mango Swirl was an attempt to create a change sides pattern for the 2 extra
club W pattern. Unfortunately, our first attempts were more mangled than mango,
and more squirrelly than swirly and thus its alternate name. There are a couple
possible transitions. Although we originally created the pattern with a
different transition, this one seems easier (especially if you've practiced the
Extra Club Turbo).

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes

> * C, D and E start with 3, left hands

In steady state, B is on a pause for beat 1, but throws D-E at the very start.

In steady state, C moves on beat 1, but is in initial position for beat 1 at the
very start.

E moves first by turning around and passing a triple to D. A moves second by
moving to the opposite side and throwing a triple to B, and so on.

The rhythm is: move, triple pass, 2 doubles to one, 1 double to the next, 2 doubles to the next. 
And repeat. Remember: *Triple-2-1-2.*

Yeah, it's kind of tricky.  You can also add two more jugglers, one to each end, to get 
 *Triple-2-1-2-1-2*!

## Egg Beaters 

### Original Egg Beater

This one has one feeder and  4 movers -- in 2 pairs of 2 spinning around each other.
A is the *handle*, B and C are one *beater*, and D and E are the other *beater*.  It's pretty
good for beginner movers on this original base count, but you have to think because your count changes 
as yout go: 6-count; 4-count; 6-count.  Performed by Mad-5 at 1997 Madfest.

### 3-4-5 Egg Beater

As your passing skills develop the original Egg-Beater gets a little boring.  The 3-4-5 variation
has the same trajectory and the same sequence of folks you pass to, but it's accelerated, and it uses both hands.    This one has 12 total
1-count beats, where the original egg-beater has 8 2-count (i.e. 16 1-count) beats.
Specifically, the feeder does 3-count and the 
egg-beaters progress through 3-count, 4-count, then 5-count.

> * Both hands counting

Since the feeder's doing 3-count, this pattern is mates with anything needing a 3-count position, such
as a 4-5 Twister.  Estimated birth, 2016.


### Egg Beater, Handle in the Batter

This variation moves the feeder to the other side of the pattern.

### Egg Beater, Switching Handles


This pattern is a cool way to get the handle into the action, continuously. It was  first done Nov 2, 17 (long
after the original egg-beater) by Graham=A, Mel=B, Mike=C, Jeff=D, Nick=E; nickname EggBeatOff). The table shows positions where each juggler (column) must be at that passing beat [right-hand counting in rows]. Only passes are indicated. So positions 1-2 exchange, similarly 3-8, 4-7, and 5-6.
The upper graph shows where each juggler moves; edge weights indicate number of right-hand counts up to next throw. Lower graph shows passing events. Start with jugglers at 4, 7, near 1, 2, and on the edge moving towards 6. There are 30 right hand beats to get around, which seems excessive but doesn’t feel so bad when juggling, thanks to symmetries I guess.

## Strange Attractor / Estranged Tractors

This came from trying to fill in the self gaps of a Turbo using two stationary jugglers.

## Whirling Melvish

Consider a 14 club box in 4-count. There's room in the middle for one or two
jugglers. If they pass with each of the corners while turning slowly in a
circle, that's the Whirling Melvish.

To make it easier, the Melvish (the juggler in the middle, who may or may not be
named Melonhead), can do 2 passes in a row to each corner.

A single transition takes from beat 1 through beat 9. At 10 it starts over with
the next corner.

The Melvish passes a straight double, pauses and then does a normal 4-count pass
to one corner (A in this case), then turns and throws an early straight double
in 4-count to the next corner. Wait for 1 beat, then resume the 4-count. Moving
after every 2 passes (1 double and 1 single) is a nice timing.

You can add an additional Whirling Melvish juggler in the middle back to back to
the original mover. That juggler starts in a 4-count with C and does the same
thing as M, 2 beats later.

## Cathedral
![](./media/image58.jpeg){width=40%}

The Cathedral is an extension of the GDP to 5 jugglers. It is a 4 leaf clover
with 2 extra clubs and all triple passes over the top. This is a spectacular
pattern, but challenging.

The outer box maintains a 14 club box in 4-count triples.

The center juggler passes once with a leaf and then replaces that leaf in a
6-count turn. The table below shows one transition, where E replaces A, and A
completes the transition facing B.

## Quincunx

Ahhh...Quincunx. We don't actually juggle this pattern much anymore. We just talk about it.
Whenever we can't think of a pattern to try, someone inevitably says, “Let's do
Quincunx!” Then we all laugh. Ha, ha! Ok, seriously. What should we do?

With no disrespect for Mike intended, this is kind of a dumb pattern. It's
complicated and almost impossible to remember for a full cycle. I haven't done
this pattern in at least 8 years, and I don't think anyone else in the MAJ has
either. (Melonhead says he still likes it...)

Now that it's a part of the MAJ mythology though, we can't take it out of the
pattern book. Maybe you should try it for yourself and see what you think!

## Ivy$-\pi$ weave (read ivy pi weave)

Here's a variation on the 2$\pi$/3.  We figured it out by adding one and then
a second feeder to fill the gap in the 3-person pattern.  Then we noticed
you could have everyone move through all the positions.   Pretty fun.
First tried Aug 27, 2017 by Mike, Mel, Conor, Nick, and Jason.
We do this on a 4-count base, which keeps the moves doable.  So, e.g., each
juggler passes 4 in a row on that count, and then has a break.  But each
juggler only passes to 2 other jugglers. Note the sharp turns going
from positions 2-to-3 and 7-to-8.

## El Turbo plus one post

Refer back to 4-person El Turbo. In variations see on adding one or two 4-count
stationary posts.
