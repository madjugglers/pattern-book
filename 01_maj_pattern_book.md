# Hello Madison Club Passers and Friends!

Welcome to the Madison Area Jugglers Book of Patterns, a collection of patterns
for intermediate to advanced passers. These patterns are part of our repertoire
and the book is a good indication of our work and a record of our evolution in
club passing at Madison.

Originally we wrote down the patterns just to save time arguing over exactly
how we did the pattern last time. (Don't worry...there's still plenty of
arguing, even with the book.) We were pleasantly surprised to find other people
found our book helpful too! The pattern book can be used as a club passing
guide or just a library of the patterns that we originated or find interesting.
If you're from Madison, then it's a handbook to what we do twice a week on
Thursdays and Sundays, and if you don't know the patterns already then you
probably will. This book is not intended to be an encyclopedia of all possible
passing patterns (that would be a big book)!


The Madison Area Jugglers (MAJ) have been attempting, inventing, and 
recording juggling patterns for longer than most of us can remember. In the 1990's, when
our memories were already getting strained by the variations, 
Version 0.1 of the passing book was compiled by Mike Newton (date?). 
Steve Otteson put in a big effort to update for Version 1.0 (date). Melonhead still 
caries around a tattered version of this printout.
Luke Emery picked up the torch and created a major update (Version 2.0, 2012), though 
this copy was not widely distributed.   In 2015 Matt Hemke, Evan Driscol,
and Nick Aitkins  created
a github repository for the project, converted Luke's version into a repo, and
updated the collection further. 
 Recently  Chan Wilson, Jeff Adamus, and
Melonhead have been recording the patterns we do at Thursday and Sunday practices.  It's
an amazing collection, and 
for those who remember the code words, like  1-5-1 Foi Graham or 3-4 Twister, it's enough
to figure out what we really did.  But most of us forget the code words after a while,
except for the frequently juggled ones, and this has been an impetus for the current 
update.  All along the editors have had 
substantial input from many members of the Madison Area Jugglers.

Our thanks go out to all of the many jugglers who have helped us. Club passing
is a social pastime that needs a group of similarly inclined jugglers. Many of
these patterns are inspired by other jugglers and patterns or created in
collaboration with other jugglers. We hope that these patterns will help
inspire new club passing ideas and help more jugglers all over the world enjoy
club passing!

All jugglers are welcome to play with, use, extend and otherwise enjoy all of
our club passing patterns.

This book may be freely reproduced and distributed for non-commercial use.

We have tried to give credit to the creators of the patterns and have indicated
when we didn't know. If we have erred in our credits, please let us know.

## How To Read Patterns

### Standard Feed

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | C     | D     | C     |
| **B**       | A     |       |       |       |
| **C**       |       | A     |       | A     |
| **D**       |       |       | A     |       |

> * Right hand counting

When juggling the cascade, each hand takes turns throwing: right, left, right,
left, etc. Usually, all of the jugglers in the pattern throw their right hand
throws at the same time, and then their left hand throws at the same time. For
most patterns, all the participants juggle at the same synchronized rate.

In general, right hand throws are made to the left hand and left hand throws
are made to the right hand. This applies to passes and self throws. (Exceptions
  will be noted when applicable.)

The two graphs above illustrate a standard feed. The position graph shows where
the jugglers stand. The left graph shows where and when passes are made.

The label "Right hand counting" means that all of the right hand throws are
numbered in the graph. The column under each number lists the jugglers that
pass at that time. Since left hand passes are never made in this particular
pattern, they are not listed in the graph. Throws that are not in the graph are
self throws.

The first column lists the jugglers in the pattern. The row where a juggler is
listed shows to whom and when that juggler passes.

For example, if I was juggler C in the above pattern, I would read along the
3rd row to see where I pass. On the first pass (column 1), I have a self throw
(the empty box represents a self throw). For the next right hand throw (column
  2), I pass to A. For the next two right hand throws, I do a self throw
  followed by a pass to A. The table rolls over, so that the fifth pass is the
  same as the first.

Unless otherwise specified, all passes are single spins and do not cross.
Doubles and triples to juggler A would be indicated by D-A and T-A respectively
and are also straight unless noted.

Special instructions like different counts, double selves, crossing passes or
starting instructions may be noted in the graph or underneath it.

### Typewriter Extra Club Feed (13 clubs)

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|:-----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **A**       | D-D   |       | D-C   |       | D-B   |       |
| **B**       |       | D-A   |       |       |       |       |
| **C**       |       |       |       | D-A   |       |       |
| **D**       |       |       |       |       |       | D-A   |

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes.
> * A starts with 4 and right hand
> * B, C and D start with left hand

Here's an example with double straight passes and special instructions. In this
case all the passes are right handed passes, but we count both left and right
hand throws. A throws right Double pass to D, then left self, then right Double
pass to C, then left self, then right Double pass to B.

*How to tip: Jugglers C and D should throw a little higher and deeper so A has
room to pass underneath to C and B.*

### Some Funny Left/Right Box

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | C     | B     |       | D     |       |
| **B**       | A     | D     | A     |       | C     |       |
| **C**       |       | A     |       | D     | B     | D     |
| **D**       |       | B     |       | C     | A     | C     |

> * Both hands counting

The above pattern has both hands counting, so the column under 1 is a right hand
pass, the column under 2 is a left hand pass, etc.

If I was juggler D, I will read the fourth row to see that I start with a right
hand self (column under 1), followed by a left hand pass to B (column under 2).
The next 4 throws are: right hand self, left hand pass to C, right hand pass to
A, and a left hand pass to C. then the pattern repeats.

Any variation to anything said above will be noted as needed when a pattern
requires special circumstances.

### Site Swaps

Occasionally passing site swaps are used to describe patterns. For example, 7
club 2-count would be 4p 3 | 3 4p (2<sup>nd</sup> juggler starts with left
hand). There are a number of different site swap notations out there for
passing. We use whatever seems to make sense to us at the moment and make no
guarantee of consistency.

## Secret Juggling Code Words (Glossary)


* **Chocolate Bar**.
  pass, pass, self, self.
* **n-count**.
  States the count when passes are made. For example, 2-count means: pass, self,
  pass, self, etc. Three count means: pass, self, self, pass, self, self, etc.
  One count means: pass, pass, pass, (no self throws).  Stating the count does not necessarily imply what hands are doing what. E.g., left-hand 2-count is different from right-hand 2-count.  Odd counts are nicely balanced for the hands, then the only issue is the start, which we usually do out of the right.
* **Everies**. 2-count
* **Every-others**. 4 count
* **Double 3-count**.  pass, pass, self: Academics usually insist that this is a  3/2 count not 2/3 count.
* **Ultimate**. 1 count
* **Feed**. A passing configuration where one juggler passes to multiple others.
* **Feeder**. One who feeds.  Usually this juggler is stationary. 
* **Feedee**. One who passes with a feeder. 
* **Feast**. A pattern having only feeders, usually arranged in a circle.
* **Carriage return**. A style of feeding where the feeder returns to the first
 feedee in the line after passing in sequence to all feedees.
* **Windshield wiper**. The more common style of feeding where the feeder 
first feeds the line in sequence, and then returns in reverse order.  Windshield wiper and carriage return are the same with two feedees, but
 differ for three or more feedees.
* **Weave**. A most popular moving pattern with three feedees and a feeder, which is the basis of many multi-person patterns.
  The 3 feedees move in a figure 8 while juggling. 
* **Preverted/Inverted.** Two moving conventions in the weave: back-on-the-end/forward-through-the-middle; or visa versa.
* **Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside**.  The two feeding positions of a doubly-fed weave.
* **Doc Blanchard/Glenn Davis**. Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside.
* **Turbo**.  Three weaving jugglers who pass among themselves and without a feeder.
* **ZOC**.
  Zone of Catchability. Refers to the area around a passer where they can catch
  passes.
* **ZOOS**. (sounds like the Greek god Zeus)  Zone of occupied space.   Space occupied by a moving juggler.
* **Immaculate Assumption**.
  When you think that a juggler is about to move or pass...maybe they even give
  you the look...you know, the **look**...but then they don't!
* **Phantom**.
  A feedee place holder who isn't really there. A feeder, for example, may feed
  2 real feeders and a phantom in a sweep feed: pass, pass, self, pass and
  repeat.
* **Mustard**.
  Energy, power, spice, velocity or chi added to throws. As in, your corner
  passes need more mustard. The opposite of mustard is mayonnaise.
* **Chalant**.
  To drop a perfectly fine pass due to lack of focus. The opposite of nonchalant.
* **NFP**.
  Nice Pass.
* **Wuss**.
  The amount of gentleness, tenderness and love added to a juggling throw.
  Compare to mayonnaise. The quality of passes you would make to your favorite
  grandmother. As in, please add some wuss to your middle passes. You're hurting
  my catching hand!
* **Southern Wisconsin convention**.  When changing sides from a feedee position in a standard count, do so on an outside-throw/inside-catch; e.g. 
 on a  right-hand throw/left-hand reception when on the right side of the 
 feedee line.
* **A Canadian catch**.   An impressive catch that would have been difficult
 for most mortal jugglers to achieve.

## Passing Pattern Philosophy

We're occasionally asked at juggling conventions, where do you come up with all
these patterns? Actually, they sort of make themselves once you invite the
opportunity. Here are some tips on how to make new passing patterns and have fun
doing it.

1. Start with a classic juggling pattern or any geometric figure (box, triangle,
  star, Y, W, line, etc.).
1. Think about everybody juggling 3 or 4 clubs.
1. Replace any selves with a pass to another juggler doing a self.
1. Any two jugglers can switch places. Any three jugglers can weave, or turbo.
1. Replace any 4-count with a Twister Weave, or a 7-club 4-count.
1. Replace any 2-count with a Weave.
1. Replace any 3-count with a double 3 count.
1. Replace any feed with an extra club feed.
1. Replace any extra club feed with a 2 extra club feed.
1. The jugglers can move in any pattern (circles, clovers, figure eights, or any
  juggling siteswap just to name a few).
1. The clubs can be passed in any juggling pattern or siteswap (admittedly,
  patterns get challenging quickly once you get past the easier siteswaps).
1. Try the same movement in a different count, or left handed.
1. Try the same passing sequence in a different movement.
1. Many of our favorite patterns are group collaborations where lots of people
  gave ideas for new ways to move or pass.
1. Share your favorite club passing patterns with other jugglers and listen to
  their ideas too.

## Random Tips on Passing Patterns
* **Better Never than Late**.
    If you miss a passing beat, don't pass on the next throw! Instead, wait for the pass
    to come around again in the pattern.
* **Always keep your eye on Mel**.
    Don't pick up the clubs until you're sure the pattern is over, unless you
    know you can pick up and keep juggling. Even when you're not juggling, it's
    wise to keep an eye on Mel.
* **Juggle slow, move fast**. You get it. There's a tendency to speed up
 your juggling when you move. Don't.
* **Juggling means never having to say you're sorry**
    No, really.  Don't say you're sorry unless you draw blood.  (However, if you draw blood then you do have to say you're sorry.)  
    Beginners often apologize profusely for their lack of skill. It's ok! We
    already know you're a beginner. But we like passing with other people and
    passing with beginners too. You'll get better soon and the best way is with
    lots of passing! If people want to do a hard pattern that is too advanced
    for beginners then they will, and you'll be left out of that one. Just do a
    pattern with somebody else. If we're juggling with you it's because we want
    to, not because we have to. Most patterns have positions of varying skill
    requirements, so if you're a beginner in a bigger or more advanced pattern,
    we'll try to put you in the best spot for your level. Just try to do the
    best you can, and if you drop, try to keep the timing anyway.
* **Throw global, catch local**.  What else would you do?

### Timing
It may already be obvious, but good timing is critical to group passing
patterns. One of the best tools to keep timing is your ears. For most patterns,
all the catches should happen at the same time. When the timing is perfectly
synchronized the sound of catching clubs is a metronome for the pattern.

Otherwise, find a juggler in your field of vision and make sure you throw at
exactly the same time as they do (either passes or selves).

Make sure all the passes of the same spin go to the same height.

For many patterns, selecting a juggler to count out loud as a metronome can be
very helpful.

### Leads
The second most important skill is for the passer to lead the catcher in the
direction they are moving. The amount of lead varies based on the height of the
throw, the tempo of the juggling, and how fast the weaver is moving.

Outside leads are the easiest, because they are thrown away from the catcher's
pattern.

Inside leads are trickier, because they are thrown towards the catcher's
pattern, and if the passer is exchanging clubs with the catcher, the two passes
are prone to collision. (For some patterns, such as the Cyclone, the weavers are
moving so fast that the inside leads go all the way on the other side of the
incoming pass.)

One key to throwing good leads is to be able to see where your passes land.
That's a difficult skill at first, and especially hard for some patterns with
high throws, but your target will certainly appreciate the effort. Otherwise,
good communication (especially for dropbacks or other blind passes) helps fine
tune lead throws.

Remember that in a feed, the feedee on the same side as the feeder's pass must
throw an inside and/or deep pass to give the feeder room to throw underneath to
the next feedee.

### Turning
Twister weaves are all about turning. In general you can classify how hard a
moving pattern is by how many selves are allocated to turn 180 degrees. For
example, the Standard Twister Weave has 5 selves (weaving in 6-count). The Fast
Spiral has 3 selves (weaving in 4-count). The Chocolate Swirl has 1 self
(crossing sides in double 3 count).

In most of these patterns you can turn either to the outside or the inside. One
turn is usually easier than the other, but I recommend jugglers learn both turns
whenever possible. Learn turning in easy patterns like the Twister Weave and
then you can apply those to Clovers or Strange Attractors and other more
advanced weaves.

It is also helpful to practice turning while juggling solo. How many selves does
it take you to turn 180 degrees while spinning continuously?

### Learning

Take advantage of opportunities to pass with jugglers better than you. That's
how you'll learn timing.

Take advantage of opportunities to pass with jugglers less skilled than you.
That's how you'll learn catching.

Be sure to pass with jugglers at the same level as you. That's how you know how
good you really are. :)

Lots of passing patterns benefit from solo skills too. You'll need to be able to
juggle 4 clubs comfortably in triple singles, double singles and the fountain to
do a lot of the 7 and 8 club based passing patterns.
